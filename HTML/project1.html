         It has been with me since my childhood when i used to make random picture,portraits with color randomly.
         I have painted over so portrains till now. Painting and drawing and reading is something that makes me feel calm and creative.
         I also participate an various drawing competition that are hold in my school from time to time.
         I am extreamly thankful for the skill that i always win rewards an applauser from my teachers.
